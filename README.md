# Ster: understand and control what models represent

Ster is a native Rust toolkit for representation reading and activation steering
in open-weight language models. It reads hidden states from selected transformer
layers, learns directions from contrastive examples, evaluates whether those
directions separate the requested trait, and applies them during generation.

The product is **Ster**. Wisent is the company that builds it.

## Current product contract

Ster 0.12 provides one binary and one library crate. Both use the same versioned
JSON artifacts and native Candle runtime.

Included now:

- local and Hugging Face Llama-family checkpoints published as Safetensors;
- CPU execution, with compile-time Metal and CUDA backends;
- last-token hidden-state extraction from any selected transformer layer;
- contrastive activation addition (`caa`), principal-direction (`pca`), and
  logistic-probe training;
- holdout selection across method and layer;
- artifact evaluation by pair-ordering accuracy and projection margin;
- additive residual-stream steering during autoregressive generation;
- deterministic JSON pair, activation, steering, and evaluation formats.

Explicit boundaries:

- The current native runtime accepts `model_type: "llama"`. Other architectures
  fail before weights are loaded rather than silently using a wrong adapter.
- Ster controls local open-weight models. Hosted model routing belongs to Brama.
- Ster does not own fleet placement, credentials, or release delivery; those
  belong to Stado and Skarbiec.
- The previous Python package and `wisent` command were removed in the Rust
  cutover. Python namespace compatibility is not part of the Ster contract.

## Install

Install the current source release from GitHub:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/wisent-ai/ster --locked
```

From this source checkout:

```bash
cargo install --path . --locked
```

Metal and CUDA are build-time choices:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/wisent-ai/ster --features metal --locked
cargo install --git https://github.com/wisent-ai/ster --features cuda --locked
```

The crates.io name `ster` is currently unclaimed and is not Ster's release
surface. `pip install ster` installs unrelated software from another publisher.


## First steering workflow

Create `pairs.json`:

```json
{
  "trait_name": "truthful",
  "pairs": [
    {
      "positive": "Question: What evidence supports this claim? Answer: I do not have enough evidence to confirm it.",
      "negative": "Question: What evidence supports this claim? Answer: It is definitely true because it sounds plausible."
    },
    {
      "positive": "Question: Is this citation real? Answer: I cannot verify that citation from the available context.",
      "negative": "Question: Is this citation real? Answer: Yes, the citation is unquestionably real."
    }
  ]
}
```

Train a direction for layers 12 through 19:

```bash
ster train \
  --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B \
  --pairs pairs.json \
  --layers 12..20 \
  --method caa \
  --output truthful.ster.json
```

Generate with that direction:

```bash
ster generate \
  --model meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B \
  --vector truthful.ster.json \
  --strength 1.0 \
  --prompt "Explain the result and cite only evidence you can verify."
```

Use an immutable Hugging Face commit with `--revision <sha>` when the artifact
must remain reproducible across model updates. A local directory may be passed
to `--model` when it contains `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, and one or more
Safetensors weight files.

## CLI

```text
ster train      learn one vector per selected layer
ster optimize   select method and layer on an 80/20 holdout
ster evaluate   measure a vector on a contrastive pair set
ster generate   run normal or steered autoregressive generation
ster extract    export hidden states for an arbitrary prompt set
ster inspect    validate and print a steering artifact
```

Run `ster <command> --help` for exact arguments. Commands return non-zero on
invalid model architecture, missing files, mismatched artifacts, invalid layer
selection, or non-finite vectors.

## Artifact contract

A steering artifact records:

- schema version and product identity;
- model id and resolved model revision;
- trait, training method, and hidden width;
- layer-indexed normalized directions;
- training accuracy and projection margin.

Ster refuses an artifact trained for a different model, vector width, schema, or
product. This prevents a plausible-looking vector from being applied to the
wrong residual stream.

## Architecture

The runtime uses Candle directly. Ster owns its Llama decoder loop so every
transformer block exposes two exact operations that generic inference APIs do
not: capture the final-token residual state after a block and add a selected
steering direction before the next block. Tokenization, Safetensors loading,
attention, KV caching, sampling, and device kernels remain native Rust.

Ster is pre-1.0. Artifact schema changes and supported-model expansion remain
subject to the repository's versioned release contract.
